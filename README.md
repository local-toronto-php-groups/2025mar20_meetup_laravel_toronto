Our very own Peter Meth is taking the podium at this meet-up to do his PHP Tek 2025 talk: "Cron Jobs Gone Wrong: The Top Mistakes That Keep Your Tasks from Ticking".

Arrive early and say hello to Peter Meth. A long-time organizer of GTA-PHP, co-organizer of the True North Conferences, seasoned PHP developer.

As well as offering to present his Conference talk to our local PHP devs, Peter wants to practice his talk, and get some feedback.

Cron jobs are like that one friend who’s reliable… until they’re not. In this lighthearted session, we’ll unpack the surprisingly common (and sometimes hilarious) pitfalls PHP developers face with cron. From endless loops to overlapping jobs that play tug-of-war, I’ll show you how to dodge the usual traps and keep your tasks ticking smoothly. Expect real-world examples, tales of cron gone wrong, and practical tips to make cron your dependable sidekick. Whether you’re new to cron or think you’ve seen it all, join in for a crash course in taming those scheduled scripts!
